This code project implements a set of test routines and a web user interface for evaluating whether submitted activity and workplace models are in compliance with P1589-2020, the IEEE standard for Augented Reality Learning Experience Models.

The web app is also hosted on github pages and can be tested (https://openarlem.github.io/arlem.js/app.html)(here).

The app is also directly integrated into the (https://github.com/ARETEedu/moodle-ARLEM_repository)(Moodle ARLEM repository plugin), there providing editing facilities for stored ARLEM content archives.
